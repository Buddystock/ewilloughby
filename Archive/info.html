        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>Buddystock, celebrating its fifth anniversary, is a celebration of friendship that began in the Summer of 2014 when traveling band Fatbook (Chicago) needed a venue to play when traveling through Portland. Fatbook played for the hockey team under the Mosier stars and Buddystock was born. Basically, friends and family gather at 1997 State Rd., Mosier, Oregon each summer to celebrate friendship – the party is entirely funded by donations to cover port-o-potties, gas money for the bands and special event insurance. No one makes any money off this get together – its just a larger than average party. 
          </p>

        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">Schedule</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>Bands begin playing at on Friday June 21th. It is typical for the music to last until the next morning. After the scheduled sets are over, we encourage free improvisation among bands. Dig it. Start Saturday off with a morning D.j set at 10.00 and expect bands to start when it feels right and last all night.  There are no scheduled bands for Sunday. Please help clean afterward as that is always appreciated and doesn’t take long if everyone pitches in. 
          </p>

        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">Buddy Stock Rules</p>

          <p>In order to be compliant with local rules all fire safety laws and alcohol laws are strictly enforced and followed. There is no common source of alcohol, its all BYOB, and all smoking must be done in a safe manner which each butt being extinguished in water and not in the brush. NO CAMPFIRES.

        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">Camping</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>Buddystock is located on private property on a cherry orchard overlooking the Columbia gorge. There is limited water so bring enough to use and to share. It is particularly windy around Buddystock time so camp in the orchard lanes to block the wind or directly behind the house. There are enough propane grills centrally located in a safe area to cook, people share a lot so typically meals are cooked and enjoyed communally--- but its also good to plan to have enough food for yourself. NO CAMPSTOVES ANYWHERE !!!!!!
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">Parking</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>Given the dryness of the grass parking is located in a designated area that has been soaked with water before hand to prevent it from catching fire. Do not park any where other than the designated area. 
          </p>

        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">Children</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>Children are welcome at Buddystock there will be a designated families camping area for quietude and such – however the music will go all night so silence is not guaranteed. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">House</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>The stages at Buddystock surround Buddy’s private residence. Buddy requests that no one enter the house during the event.

        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">Food and Drinks</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>People share food at Buddystock but there is no guarantee that there will be enough for everyone. Try to coordinate with others on meals. It cannot be enforced enogh but there are to be NO CAMPSTOVES!!!! This year we are going to try to have food trucks show up but its no guarantee.  This is not an organized festival—its more like a hangout at a friend’s house. THERE IS NO COMMON SOURCE OF ALCOHOL!!!!
