        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">THANK YOU!</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>Thank you for being a part of Buddystock V. The whole point of Buddystock is to have fun with music and we want to maximize the radness for all involved. Please dig the following information to find zen in the world of wires and speaker cabs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">BEFORE YOU PLAY</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>Kevin will be running sound for Buddystock- Thanks Kevin!!! Please send a band representative to check in with him at the mixing desk 45min before your set to give Kevin an idea of your stage set up. This is important - PLEASE DO IT. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">STAGE</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>We will have big ass speakers and big ass monitors. The system is based around JBL SR stacks driven by Crown macro-tech power amps running into a 16 channel Allen & Heath Board. There will be 3 SM-58 vocal mics, if you want to bring your own vocal mic - totally cool. We will have a stereo DI box as well as a k&K preamp DI for Acoustic guitars. There will be dedicated stereo XLR cables for Keyboards. The stage is on Buddy's deck and there is plenty of room. Check the pics to get an idea. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">DRUMS</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>I will be bringing my beater kit. I'm not a drummer and it is what it is. It has a Japanese Tama kick, one 8" tom and a 16" floor drum.  Drummers please bring sticks, cymbals and a snare drum. If this kit is below your minimum operating standards, feel free to bring your own. If anyone has a better kit and feels like sharing - please let me know. That would be hella rad and I will up-date this page accordingly. There will also be congas available for anyone to use. We will be micing the kick with a beta 52 and the snare with a sm57.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">BASS</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>We will have a bass amp for you (Thanks Jesse!). I am assured it is meaty and will meet your bassy needs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">GUITARS</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>Bring your own guitars and amps. If you don't feel like bringing one, it's up to you to hustle one up before your set. We plan on micing them to get the best possible levels out front. We have a sm57 and a sennheiser 609 for guitar cabs.  
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">KEYS</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>Bring your own board. I will bring 2 keyboard stands and a KXD 12" Berhinger keyboard amp that anyone can use. If you play sitting down, bring a bench.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">SET LENGTH</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>Please try your best to stay within your set length. If you have a 45 min set, aim for 10 min setup, 30 min music and 5 min break down. If you have an hour set, aim for 10 min setup, 45 min music and 5 min breakdown. If we get off schedule, no worries, but try to stay within your assigned length.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">AFTER YOUR SET</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>When you are done playing please breakdown your gear before wandering off. There are a lot of bands and we want the set change to be as smooth as possible. Again - Please get your gear off the stage before you leave the deck.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">LOADING/UNLOADING</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>You can drive your vehicle up the main driveway to the deck to load and unload. Do not park there - this is a loading zone only. All other parking will be in the lot next to buddy's. If you drive to the deck at night PLEASE TURN OFF your headlights so you don't interfere with the musicians on stage. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">STORAGE</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>There is plenty of gear storage on either side of the stage. We will be using the stage left as the green room. Feel free to stash you gear for a while if you feel like jamming later.  
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="rainbow" style="font-size: 32px; background: white; padding: 10px">HAVE FUN AND JAMMING</p>
        <div class = panel2 style = 'z-index: 5'>
          <p>Have fun and party down. After the scheduled set ends feel free to jam. Please be open and inclusive. At buddystock everyone's a buddy and music is the word. Cheers!
